# xxxman360-OS
An operating system created in C#. Very basic in function and can fit on a 3.5" Floppy Disk.

# About
xxxman360 OS was created as a way to try to make a simple operating system in Cosmos OS without using
a canvas. Only the Console was used, while still having a GUI. It was also created as a way for me (the creator)
to get more familiar with the C# programming language. The operating system does not use a file system, so all
settings are temporary and will revert back to the hardcoded settings upon reboot.
Have fun trying it out! You might learn something from it, too!
